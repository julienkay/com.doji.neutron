# Neutron

[OpenUPM]

A neural network viewer as an editor extension built for/with Unity Sentis

## About

The name and the general idea are obviously <strike>stolen from</strike> inspired by [Netron](https://netron.app/), which is better suited as a viewer in most cases.

I guess one advantage of this package is to view a model the way it gets imported into Unity including all the optimizations that are applied.
Another reason I created this initially was to quickly get an overview of the layers that will fall back to CPU execution.

## Usage

Go to Windows -> Neutron to open the model viewer. Then in your Project window select the .onnx/.sentis file you want to view.

## Known Issues

- Layouting is far from perfect
